  aboutMe:
    `I'm Jerome, a student who is passionate about computing. I started coding in Secondary 2 and fell in love with it ever since.
    <br><br>
    I'm currently interested in cybersecurity and regularly participate in CTFs. If you need a Pyjail expert hmu ðŸ”¥
    <br><br>
    Outside of computing, I like playing ShellShockers and listening to heavy metal!
