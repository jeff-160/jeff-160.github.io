I'm Jerome, a student who is passionate about computing. I started coding in Secondary 2 and fell in love with it ever since. I mainly use Python, JavaScript and C++.    
  
I'm currently interested in cybersecurity and regularly participate in CTFs. If you need a Pyjail expert hmu 🔥  

Outside of computing, I like playing ShellShockers and listening to heavy metal!
